# Student Verification System - Complete Implementation

## 🎓 Overview

The Student Verification System has been fully implemented to provide student discounts for specific colleges/institutes. The system separates referral codes (for influencers) from promo codes (for students/admin), requires file upload verification, and includes a comprehensive admin management panel.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Separated Code System**
- **Referral Codes**: For influencer commissions (e.g., `INFL001`)
- **Promo Codes**: For admin/student discounts (e.g., `VIT25`, `PES20`)
- **Clear Visual Separation**: Different input fields with appropriate icons

### 2. **Student ID Verification Workflow**
- **File Upload**: Students upload ID card, admission letter, fee receipt, or bonafide
- **College Validation**: Email domain verification against configured colleges
- **Admin Review**: Manual verification with approve/reject/under-review status
- **Automated Discount**: Applied after successful verification

### 3. **College Configuration System**
- **Pre-configured Colleges**: VIT Vellore (25%), PES Bangalore (20%), MIT Manipal (22%)
- **Email Domain Validation**: `@vitstudent.ac.in`, `@pes.edu`, `@manipal.edu`
- **Flexible Settings**: Discount percentage, max amounts, allowed courses
- **Admin Management**: Add/edit/deactivate colleges dynamically

### 4. **Enhanced Booking Flow**
- **Step 1**: Student enters promo code → System validates college eligibility
- **Step 2**: If eligible, system prompts for document upload
- **Step 3**: Student fills form and uploads ID document
- **Step 4**: Booking proceeds with pending verification status
- **Step 5**: Admin reviews and approves/rejects verification
- **Step 6**: Discount applied retroactively upon approval

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables Required:
```env
# File Upload (if using cloud storage)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Email Notifications
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Production Setup:
1. **File Storage**: Configure cloud storage (Cloudinary/AWS S3) for uploaded documents
2. **Email Service**: Set up SMTP for verification status notifications
3. **Database**: Migrate from localStorage to actual database (PostgreSQL/Supabase)
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for verification queue and file upload failures

## 📈 Future Enhancements
