## âœ… MONITORING SETUP

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Set up monitoring for:
# - https://your-domain.com/health

# - Razorpay transaction logs
# - Browser console errors
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] Page load performance
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Payment success rates
- [ ] User registration rates
- [ ] Error rates by endpoint

## âœ… ROLLBACK PLAN

### If Critical Issues Occur:

#### Immediate Actions (< 5 minutes)
1. **Revert Deployment**: Vercel Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ Promote previous working version
2. **Database Issues**: Execute emergency RLS disable (use with caution)
3. **Payment Issues**: Switch Razorpay to test mode temporarily

#### Recovery Actions (< 30 minutes)
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Check logs in Vercel, Supabase, and Razorpay
2. **Fix Issues**: Apply specific fixes based on root cause
3. **Re-deploy**: Test fix and redeploy
4. **Verify**: Complete end-to-end testing

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA
âœ… Zero critical bugs in production
âœ… All payment flows working correctly
âœ… Admin panel fully operational
âœ… Page load times under 3 seconds
âœ… Mobile experience optimized
âœ… Error handling graceful

## ðŸ“ž EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
If any critical issues arise post-deployment:
1. **STOP**: Don't panic, assess the situation
2. **COMMUNICATE**: Notify stakeholders immediately
3. **ROLLBACK**: Use Vercel rollback if needed
4. **FIX**: Identify and resolve root cause
5. **TEST**: Verify fix before redeploying
6. **MONITOR**: Watch closely for 24 hours post-fix

**Remember: Better to rollback quickly than leave broken features live!**
