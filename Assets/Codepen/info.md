## Component Requirements (MUST be used as-is)
the codes for the component will be provided,if required ask the user.
1. **Footer Social Links**  
   Source: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Xenos_Arcanum/pen/LYeoppv)  
   - Only keep **Instagram** and **Facebook** icons.  
   - This exact style must be used, not recreated.

2. **Event Card**  
   Source: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/rRaEYv)  
   - Show the **full event image** (not cropped).  
   - Below the image: description, venue, time/date.  
   - Add a **Book Now button** using the Button component (see #4).  
   - Each card maps strictly to one event.

3. **Shader Background**  
   Source: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/chrisjdesigner/pen/dymOxrZ)  
   - Use as the **background of the hero section**.  
   - Must be dark purple with a matte finish.  
   - Do not replace with gradients; use the shader as provided.

4. **Buttons**  
   Source: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/matovius/pen/qBeqJXX)  
   - Every button in the app (CTA buttons, Book Now, Sign In, Submit, Admin actions, etc.) must use this style.  
   - No other button styling allowed.

5. **Glassmorph Dialogues**  
   Source: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/fghty/pen/PojKNEG)  
   - Every modal, booking form, dialogue box, admin form, etc. must use this glassmorph component.  
   - Must preserve the transparency, blur, and border glow as in the original.

## Functional Flow

- Book Now button ‚Üí opens glassmorph booking modal with event-specific details.  
- Submit ‚Üí `/api/book` ‚Üí forwards to Google Form (server-side).  
- User sees confirmation message.

- Auth with NextAuth (email/Google + admin role).  
- Admin events CRUD (protected routes).  
- Image upload via Cloudinary or S3.  

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsive & mobile-first.  
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard focus).  
- Performance (lazy images, optimized).  
- No design modifications of CodePen components.  

## Deployment
- Host on Vercel.  
- Environment variables:
  - `GOOGLE_FORM_ID`
  - `GOOGLE_ENTRY_*` (for field mappings)
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL`
  - `CLOUDINARY_URL` or `S3_BUCKET_URL`
  - `DATABASE_URL` (if Supabase/Postgres used)

### üö® STRICT INSTRUCTION TO CLAUDE:
- **Do not restyle or ‚Äúapproximate‚Äù the CodePen components.**  
- Integrate the CodePen HTML/CSS **directly** into React components inside the Next.js project.  
- Map props (title, image, venue, etc.) to replace the hardcoded demo text/images in the CodePen examples.  
- Only adjustments allowed: making images fully visible in Event Card, and inserting Book Now button under content.
